    description: This table contains block level data for the Base Blockchain, Goerli Testnet. This table can be used to analyze trends at a block level, for example gas fees vs. total transactions over time. For more information on Base, please see [Base Documentation](https://docs.base.org/). For more information on EVM transactions, please see [Etherscan Resources](https://etherscan.io/directory/Learning_Resources/Ethereum) or [The Ethereum Organization](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/blocks/).

    columns:
      - name: BLOCK_NUMBER
        description: Also known as block height. The block number, which indicates the length of the blockchain, increases after the addition of each new block.
      - name: BLOCK_TIMESTAMP
        description: The date and time at which the block was produced.
      - name: NETWORK
        description: The network of the blockchain used by a transaction.
      - name: BLOCKCHAIN
        description: The blockchain on which transactions are being confirmed.
      - name: TX_COUNT
        description: Total number of transactions within a block.
      - name: DIFFICULTY
        description: The effort required to mine the block.
      - name: TOTAL_DIFFICULTY
        description: Total difficulty of the chain at a given block.
      - name: EXTRA_DATA
        description: Any data included by the validator for a given block.
      - name: GAS_LIMIT
        description: Total gas limit provided by all transactions in the block.
      - name: GAS_USED
        description: Total gas used in the block.
      - name: HASH
        description: The hash of the block header for a given block.
      - name: PARENT_HASH
        description: The hash of the block from which a given block is generated. Also known as the parent block.
      - name: RECEIPTS_ROOT
        description: The root of the state trie.
      - name: SHA3_UNCLES
        description: The mechanism which Ethereum Javascript RLP encodes an empty string.
      - name: SIZE
        description: Block size, which is determined by a given block's gas limit.
      - name: UNCLE_BLOCKS
        description: Uncle blocks occur when two blocks are mined and broadcasted at the same time, with the same block number. The block validated across the most nodes will be added to the primary chain, and the other one becomes an uncle block. Miners do receive rewards for uncle blocks.
      - name: BLOCK_HEADER_JSON
        description: This JSON column contains the block header details.
